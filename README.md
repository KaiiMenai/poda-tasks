## Setup
Sign up for a free GitHub Account.
Go to the Repository page in GitHub through the browser.
Click on the GREEN Code button.
Click on the Codespaces tab.
Click Create New Codespace on main.
Laugh at the random generated Codespace name.

## Technologies
1. Python
2. Git
3. GitHub
4. Codespaces
5. Jupyter

## Notes and Tips
To save changes made to the README file:
- Click on Source Control option on the left.
- In Message box, enter what the changes were i.e. changed README.
- Click on the Commit button and this will save changes to the project, this will save the state of the project as it is now.

To sync the changes with GitHub:
- Following saving changes to the README file through the Source Control and Commit functions, there should now be a Sync Changes button.
- Click on the Sync Changes button, this will then sync the commited changes from the development environment (github.dev) with GitHub.

IF Codespaces throws 403 ERROR when attempting COMMIT:
- Check login details.
- Check Access and Permissions.
- Honestly just easier to make a new repository and copy everything over.

## Summary of Content in Jupyter Notebook
### Task 1: Source the Data Set
Importing the Iris dataset from https://gist.github.com/curran/a08a1080b88344b0c8a7 using https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html to make Python be able to read the csv easier.
### Task 2: Explore the Data Structure
Dataset Loaded in. 150 samples, accross 5 variables including 'sepal_length', 'sepal_width', 'petal_length', 'petal_width', and 'species'.
First and last 5 rows were printed using: sliced_df = pd.concat([df.head(5), df.tail(5)])
