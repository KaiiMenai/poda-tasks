## Notes and Tips
To save changes made to the README file:
- Click on Source Control option on the left.
- In Message box, enter what the changes were i.e. changed README.
- Click on the Commit button and this will save changes to the project, this will save the state of the project as it is now.

To sync the changes with GitHub:
- Following saving changes to the README file through the Source Control and Commit functions, there should now be a Sync Changes button.
- Click on the Sync Changes button, this will then sync the commited changes from the development environment (github.dev) with GitHub.

IF Codespaces throws 403 ERROR when attempting COMMIT:
- Check login details.
- Check Access and Permissions.
- Honestly just easier to make a new repository and copy everything over.
